## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was my first project and first major application of all round theoretical knowledge of HTML and CSS.

I also learned to apply the CSS Grid model, with a minor application of Flexbox. 

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to practice basic HTML and CSS more broadly. I understand most of the principles, but feel like now I need to try different projects and learn by 'doing'

Within CSS and HTML, I'd like to strength my knowledge on:
- Git, Github, and website deployment
- Grid and Flexbox in CSS
- Forms, tables and links in  HTML
